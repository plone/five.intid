Changelog
=========

0.4.1 - Mar 17, 2009
--------------------

- Fix missing zcml file in prior release

0.4.0 - Mar 17, 2009
--------------------

- Raise NotYet exception in the default keyreference constructor when the
  object does not yet have a proper path. This avoids problems of premature
  key references being created and pointing to the parent of the object or
  a non-existent object.
  [optilude]

0.3.0 - Nov 07, 2008
--------------------

- Add unreferenceable implementations of intid event handlers and IKeyReference
  to deal with IPersistent objects that are never actually persisted, such as
  the CMFCore directory view objects.
  [mj]

- Remove the explicit exceptions for CMFCore directory view objects and use
  subscriber and adapter registrations against unreferenceable instead.
  [mj]

0.2.1 - Nov 05, 2008
--------------------

- Avoid unnecessary adapter lookups in __cmp__ as __cmp__
  is called rather often and is performance sensitive.
  Cumulative time now 0.080 vs previous 1.820 for 6000 compares
  when profiling.
  [tesdal]

- Avoid redundant __cmp__ calls in BTree traversal.
  [tesdal]

0.2.0 - May 20, 2008
--------------------

  [wichert]
