Changelog
=========

1.1.2 (2016-09-09)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Prevent errors on ``removeIntIdSubscriber`` when the ``IKeyReference`` adapter
  raises a ``NotYet``, e.g. because the object does not have a proper path.
  [ale-rt]


1.1.1 (2016-08-19)
------------------

Fixes:

- Acquisition-unwrap each item in the aq_iter chain, as ``getSite().__parent__`` might return an object aquired from the original context which breaks the parent loop detection.
  [thet]

- Prevent errors on ``moveIntIdSubscriber`` when the ``IKeyReference`` adapter
  raises a ``NotYet``, e.g. because the object does not have a proper path.
  [ale-rt]


1.1.0 (2016-02-14)
------------------

New:

- Enhancement: follow PEP8 and Plone code conventions
  [jensens]

Fixes:

- Fix: Make it work with Acquisition>=4.0.1 (and require the version).
  Circular acquisitions were - prior to the above version - not
  detected.  Now they are and adaption just fails with a "Could not
  adapt" for circulars.  Any attribute access fails with a verbose
  RuntimeError.  Cleanup also circular containment workarounds.
  [jensens]

1.0.3 - 2012-10-05
------------------

- Make sure the IConnection adapter works for unwrapped persistent
  objects.

- Only ignore 'temporary' objects in the ObjectAddedEvent event handler.
  [mj]

1.0.1 - 2011-11-30

  [mj]

  [hannosch]

  [hannosch]

  [Arfrever]

  [robgietema]

0.5.1 - August 4, 2010
----------------------

- Fix tests to pass with the corrected tp_name of ImplicitAcquisitionWrapper
  in Acquisition 2.13.1.
  [davisagli]

0.5.0 - February 6, 2010
------------------------

- Use only non-deprecated zope imports, five.intid now only supports
  Zope 2.12+.
  [alecm]

0.4.4 - February 6, 2010
------------------------

- Fix POSKeyError when the root object is not in the same database
  than the object you are trying to resolve to.
  [thefunny42]

- Fixed all deprecated imports and updated setup.py
  [thet, wichert]

- Fixed tests to reflect changed Zope API
  [thet]

0.4.3 - July 19, 2009
---------------------

- When looking for an object by path, treat an AttributeError the same as a
  NotFound error. unrestrictedTraverse() raises an AttributeError in certain
  cases when it can't traverse.
  [optilude]

0.4.2 - Apr 26, 2009
--------------------

- Install utility in a more permanent manner.
  [alecm]

- Drop `five:traversable` statement. It was deprecated since Zope 2.10.
  [hannosch]

- Use `objectEventNotify` from zope.component.event instead of zope.app.event.
  The later was deprecated since Zope 2.10.
  [hannosch]

- Specify package dependencies.
  [hannosch]

0.4.1 - Mar 17, 2009
--------------------

- Fix missing zcml file in prior release

0.4.0 - Mar 17, 2009
--------------------

- Raise NotYet exception in the default keyreference constructor when the
  object does not yet have a proper path. This avoids problems of premature
  key references being created and pointing to the parent of the object or
  a non-existent object.
  [optilude]

0.3.0 - Nov 07, 2008
--------------------

- Add unreferenceable implementations of intid event handlers and IKeyReference
  to deal with IPersistent objects that are never actually persisted, such as
  the CMFCore directory view objects.
  [mj]

- Remove the explicit exceptions for CMFCore directory view objects and use
  subscriber and adapter registrations against unreferenceable instead.
  [mj]

0.2.1 - Nov 05, 2008
--------------------

- Avoid unnecessary adapter lookups in __cmp__ as __cmp__
  is called rather often and is performance sensitive.
  Cumulative time now 0.080 vs previous 1.820 for 6000 compares
  when profiling.
  [tesdal]

- Avoid redundant __cmp__ calls in BTree traversal.
  [tesdal]

0.2.0 - May 20, 2008
--------------------

- Cleanup documentation a little bit so it can be used for the pypi page.
  [wichert]

- Many changes by many people.
  [alecm, hannosch, maurits, mborch, reinout, rockt, witsch]


0.1.4 - November 11, 2006
-------------------------

- First public release.
